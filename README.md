## Introduction

Tracking activities provides real-time visibility into the progress of tasks and projects. Instead of relying solely on initial plans, tracking allows me to see what's actually happening, making it possible to identify potential issues early and make timely adjustments. This dashboard visualizes my personal time-tracking data and allows me to analyze my own life matrics and understand time allocation and time to completion of activities.
